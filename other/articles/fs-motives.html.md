Don't make the mistake of supposing that all software development has one simple motive. Here are some of the motives we know influence many people to write free software. Human nature is complex, and it is quite common for a person to have multiple simultaneous motives for a single action. Each person is different, and there could be other motives that are missing from this list. If you know of other motives not listed here, please send email to <campaigns@gnu.org>. If we think the other motives are likely to influence many developers, we will add them to the list.
